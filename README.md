# Bank-Account-Management-System

WELCOME TO MY MINI-PROJECT!

This Java program is designed to simulate a bank account management system that maintains a minimum balance. If the account balance falls below this threshold due to a withdrawal, the system raises a warning and disallows the operation.

### Features:

1. **Open Account**: Users can create a new bank account with an initial deposit.
2. **Deposit**: Add funds to the existing account balance.
3. **Withdraw**: Remove funds from the account balance, ensuring it doesn't fall below the minimum threshold.
4. **Check Balance**: View the current balance of the account.
5. **Minimum Balance Enforcement**: The system ensures that the account balance never goes below a specified minimum level.
